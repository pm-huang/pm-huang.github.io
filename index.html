	<h1>Lyrics</h1>

        <p><em>Translated by ChatGPT.</em></p>

	<p>Lyrics: Huang Pengmei<br>
	Music: Shengzi / Huang Pengmei</p>

	<p>Just like a reunion after a long time,<br>
	It feels like a sudden spark of the heart.<br>
	A perfect encounter,<br>
	Does it always come with an end?</p>

	<p>You embrace everything, free and wild,<br>
	Letting the story have a loyal listener.<br>
	You make me believe I’m not ordinary,<br>
	Breathing freely in the winds of freedom.<br>
	You make me believe I’m not ordinary,<br>
	Breathing freely in the winds of freedom, you—</p>

	<p>You are a rainbow at the edge of the sky,<br>
	A sweet cone with a taro flavor,<br>
	There’s never a feeling that can compare<br>
	To walking through the streets of Chengdu.</p>

	<p>The water flow of Dujiangyan,<br>
	The evening breeze on Chunxi Road,<br>
	The little boat on Xinglong Lake,<br>
	All speak of a wish to stay.<br>
	There’s no reason to leave,<br>
	No matter how long we’ve been together, it’s never enough.<br>
	Perhaps you can understand this feeling of mine.</p>

	<p>Just like a reunion after a long time,<br>
	It feels like a sudden spark of the heart.<br>
	A perfect encounter,<br>
	Does it always come with an end?</p>

	<p>You affirm all the brave dreams,<br>
	Letting the story have a loyal listener.<br>
	You make me believe I’m not mediocre,<br>
	Breathing freely in the winds of freedom.<br>
	You make me believe I’m not mediocre,<br>
	Breathing freely in the winds of freedom, you—</p>

	<p>You are the tender green willow in late autumn,<br>
	The spring and autumn in a poet’s pen,<br>
	There’s never a feeling that can compare<br>
	To walking through the streets of Chengdu.</p>

	<p>The bridge ropes of Shixiang Lake,<br>
	The sky over Bailu Town,<br>
	The bell tower of Wenshu Temple,<br>
	All silently waiting.<br>
	There’s no reason to leave,<br>
	No matter how long we’ve been together,<br>
	Just let me choose to stay.</p>

	<p>Just like a reunion after a long time,<br>
	It feels like a sudden spark of the heart.<br>
	The future, embraced with you,<br>
	Will fulfill all our endless dreams.</p>p>
